# SignatureFix
Cities Skylines II mod that fixes always-empty industrial signature buildings i.e. Dairy House, Oil Refinery and Ground Earth. They will now have companies producing Food, Petrochemicals and Minerals, respectively.
Note 1. Please note that this is a temporary fix only until CO will fix those buildings properly.
Note 2. If you already have the buildings plopped, then please remove them first and build again. Also, make sure that you plop them in a suitable industrial area.
